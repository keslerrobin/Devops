Thesis Matrix DevOps

Hi, my name is Robin, 4th semester student and currently working on my internship and thesis. I am doing my internship at a West Flemish SME that makes modern cutting machines in Nieuwpoort, namely the company Marelec.

For my thesis it is the intention that I help the develops team that is responsible for the software Martix further with DevOps.
I will do this through the Jenkins program.

I need code for that. And this repository serves as a test git that will contain the code for my project to test.
